# ESPHome

This repo contains the configuration yamls to use ESPHome framework on ESP8266/ESP32 microcontrollers.

These microcontrollers are replacement firmwares for smart devices that allow local control and easy integration into HomeAssistant so that I can use them in my smart home with Apple HomeKit.
